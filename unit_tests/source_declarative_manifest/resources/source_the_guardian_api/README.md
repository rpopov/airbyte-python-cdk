# The Guardian API Tests

For these tests to work, you'll need to create a `secrets.yaml` file in this directory that looks like this:

```yml
api_key: ******
```

The `.gitignore` file in this directory should ensure your file is not committed to git, but it's a good practice to double-check. ðŸ‘€
