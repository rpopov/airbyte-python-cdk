    """
    Navigate a path through the JSON structure to the records to retrieve. Extend the records with service fields
    applicable to their filtering and transformation.

    Like the DpathExtractor, extract records from a response by following a path of names  of nested objects,
    while adding specific service fields to the extracted records to facilitate the further processing.

    Service fields:
      root: Binds the original response body, the record was extracted from. This allows the record access any attribute
      in any nested object, navigating from the root field.

      parent: Binds a map of the parent object's attributes, including its "parent" service field. This way the extracted
      record has access to the attributes of any object This is especially useful when the records are extracted from
      nested lists.

    Example:
      body: {"a":1, "b":2, "c":{"d":4}}\n
      path: {c}\n
      record: {"d":4,"parent": { "a":1, "b":2}, "root": { "a":1, "b":2, "c":{"d":4}}}\n
      access: {{ record.d }}, {{ record["parent"].a }}, {{ record["parent"].b }}, {{ record.["root"].a }}...

    Example:
      body: {"a":1, "b":2, "c":[{"d":4},{"e",5}]}\n
      path: {c, *}\n
      record 1: {"d":4, "parent":{ "a":1, "b":2}, "root":{ "a":1, "b":2, "c":[{"d":4},{"e",5}]})\n
      record 2: {"e",5, "parent":{ "a":1, "b":2}, "root":{ "a":1, "b":2, "c":[{"d":4},{"e",5}]})\n
      access: {{ record.d }}, {{ record["parent"].a }}, {{ record["parent"].b }}, {{ record.["root"].a }}...

    Example:
      body: { "a":1, "b":2, "c":{"d":4, "e":{"f":6}}}\n
      path: {c,e}\n
      record: {"f":6, "parent": {"d":4, parent: { "a":1, "b":2}},"root":{ "a":1, "b":2, "c":{"d":4, "e":{"f":6}}}}\n
      access: {{ record.f }}, {{ record["parent"].d }}, {{ record["parent"]["parent"].a }},\n
      {{ record["parent"]["parent"].b }},{{ record.["root"].a }}, {{ record.["root"].a.c.d }}...

    Note:
        The names of the service fields have a specific prefix like $ set in SERVICE_KEY_PREFIX.\n
        When the result record is the body object itself, then the "parent" service field is not set (as it is None).\n
        When the parent contains no attributes and no parent service field, the parent field is not bound.\n
        The "root" service field is always set in the result record.
