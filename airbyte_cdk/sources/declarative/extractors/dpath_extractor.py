class DpathExtractor(RecordExtractor):
    """
    Record extractor that searches a decoded response over a path defined as an array of fields.

    If the field path points to an array, that array is returned.
    If the field path points to an object, that object is returned wrapped as an array.
    If the field path points to an empty object, an empty array is returned.
    If the field path points to a non-existing path, an empty array is returned.

    Examples of instantiating this transform:
    ```
      extractor:
        type: DpathExtractor
        field_path:
          - "root"
          - "data"

      extractor:
        type: DpathExtractor
        field_path:
          - "root"
          - "{{ parameters['field'] }}"
    ```

    ```
      extractor:
        type: DpathExtractor
        field_path: []
    ```

    Attributes:
        field_path (Union[InterpolatedString, str]): Path to the field that should be extracted
        config (Config): The user-provided configuration as specified by the source's spec
